# Traffic Signs Recognition
A python script designed to identify different traffic signs using image processing.  
The script has four stages, the first is a perfect cut of the sign with no text and a fixed size, the second stage is 
the same as the first one but with some text beneath the image.</br>
The third stage is with dynamic size of the sign frame and the fourth stage is with some distortion in the images.</br>
The supported signs are the ones illustrated in the following image.
